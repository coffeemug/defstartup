The idea that startups should talk to users is conventional
wisdom. Great founders talk to users, so most founders signal their
greatness by making a point that they do it too. But empirically
talking to users is so hard that people make excuses not to do it, and
then convince themselves that they're extremely user focused.

The problem is that "talk to users" is too vague to be
falsifiable. How do you know if you're doing it right? Here is a quick
rule of thumb. __You're doing it right if you can get a third of
potential users to pay you money within a month of initial contact.__

The numbers aren't exact, but they're ballpark right. If you're off by
ten percentage points or a month or two, you're probably ok. If you
can only get 1% of potential users to pay you after a year of back and
forth, your company will probably die. What if your company is
different? It _might_ be, but it probably isn't. Unless you _really_
know what you're doing, the balance of probabilities is that you're
making excuses and convincing yourself that it's ok.

Beyond giving you the tools to falsify your own beliefs, this rule of
thumb has a few other very useful properties.

Firstly, getting a ~.3 probability of close is _really hard_. Shooting
for this number will force you to do two things: (a) build a product
someone other than you _actually_ finds valuable, and (b) dramatically
tighten the definition of your target market. This will instantly put
you on the right track because most successful startups do this well,
while most failed startups do the inverse (bad product for an overly
broad market).

Secondly, when you start hiring sales people, they'll love you. The
two biggest challenges in early sales is (a) deciding whether a new
lead is worth pursuing, and (b) deciding when to cut your losses on an
opportunity. A narrow target market definition helps with the first
part, and having a concrete time bound helps with the second.

Thirdly, when you start hiring marketing people, they'll love you
too. The biggest challenge in marketing is how to cost-effectively
generate high quality leads. A great product built for a narrow market
solves this problem nearly automatically.

Fourthly, a combination of great product, sales, and marketing
fundamentals is a solid foundation for growth. Assuming you've picked
a market that's growing fast, your startup will grow fast with it.

Finally, actually focusing on getting paid will get you revenue
early. That will put you in a dramatically better negotiating position
in every VC deal, make it easier to recruit great talent, and
supercharge morale in your company. Since startups live and die by
momentum, tangible early success built on real discipline tends to
turn into a self-fulfilling prophecy.
